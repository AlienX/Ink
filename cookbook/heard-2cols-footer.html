                        Is it not a saying in every one's mouth, Possession is half of the law:
                        that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often possession
                        is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of Russian serfs
                        and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is the whole of
                        the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow's last mite but a
                        Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain's marble mansion with a door-plate
                        for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish? What is the ruinous discount
                        which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor Woebegone, the bankrupt, on
                        a loan to keep Woebegone's family from starvation; what is that ruinous
                        discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the Archbishop of Savesoul's income of
                        L100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands
                        of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven without any of Savesoul's
                        help) what is that globular L100,000 but a Fast-Fish? What are the Duke
                        of Dunder's hereditary towns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted
                        harpooneer, John Bull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic
                        lancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all
                        these, is not Possession the whole of the law?

                        But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the kindred
                        doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is internationally
                        and universally applicable.

                        What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the
                        Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress?
                        What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What India to England?
                        What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All Loose-Fish.

                    <p>
                        What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but Loose-Fish?
                        What all men's minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is the principle
                        of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to the ostentatious
                        smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose-Fish? What
                        is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And what are you, reader, but
                        a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?

                        Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the
                        context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
                        that land, the King, as Honourary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,
                        and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division which,
                        in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no intermediate remainder.
                        Now as this law, under a modified form, is to this day in force in England;
                        and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general
                        law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in a separate chapter,
                        on the same courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be
                        at the expense of a separate car, specially reserved for the accommodation
                        of royalty. In the first place, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned
                        law is still in force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that
                        happened within the last two years.

                                a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore.
                                Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of
