                <h2>Foundation</h2>
                <p>The way you build layouts in Ink is its prime differentiator from other available web UI frameworks and also one of its strongest suits. You'll find Ink's approach is very intuitive and will have anyone building layouts quickly and consistently.</p>
                <p>So, let's get started with the basics, then we will expand upon that so that you can leave this page knowing, not only how to build a layout from scratch, but also how to simultaneously build for three screen sizes.</p>
                <p class="ink-vspace"><span class="ink-label info">Tip</span> Before diving into the documentation, download the Ink package available on our <a href="./">homepage</a>
                so you can try as you go along.</p>
                <h3>The container</h3>
                <p>The block-level element you wrap your entire page with is usually called your container and Ink uses that tried and tested method to get the layout started. This container will define the width of your page, be it a fixed or relative measurement. You can customize this measurement in the <a href="/download">Ink Customizer</a>, by changing the <code>@ink-site-width</code> variable.</p>
                <p><span class="ink-label info">Code</span></p>
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;div class=&quot;ink-grid&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your content here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;                </pre>
                <h3>The Column Groups</h3>
                <p>If you want a single-column page, then you don't need anything else, just use your <code>ink-grid</code> and pour your content into it. However, if you want a more common column-based layout, then you're going to need to start thinking in rows of side-by-side columns, what we, in Ink, call <code>column-group</code>.</p>
                <p>A row is simply a wrapper of columns that keeps them together and helps align spacing between them. You only need a row if you have more than one column side-by-side, otherwise, either just put your content straight in the <code>ink-grid</code> or use a single, specific-width, column.</p>
                <p><span class="ink-label info">Code</span></p>
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;div class=&quot;ink-grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;column-group&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;One column&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Another column&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;                </pre>
                <h3>The columns</h3>
                <p>Columns in Ink are always fluid, because they're always percentage-based. How much they stretch depends on your page width, as defined in the <code>ink-grid</code>. This makes column pairing a very simple and intuitive mathematical operation.</p>
                <p>If you need two columns taking half of your container each, then make two 50% columns. If you need a 60/40 layout, then just use a 60% and a 40% column. Need three columns, one of which takes up 20% of the space and the other divide the rest between them? Then, use a 20% column and two 40% columns. It's that simple and you'll be surprised how easy it is to make it work across different screens, but more on that in a minute.</p>
                <h4>Basic columns: the 'large' screen</h4>
                <p>To get you acquainted with the concept, we'll first explain how this works for large screens, large being an abstract concept used only to make things more intuitive.</p>
                <p>Ink offers all manners of percentage-based widths, from 10 to 100% with various intervals which are combinable to add up to 100 and these are accessible via the <code>large-xxx</code> classes, in which the 'large-' defines the screen size and 'xxx' is a number from 10 to 100 in the intervals we'll list below.</p>
                <p>Let's continue our previous code and make the two columns into halves of our available space. <span class="ink-label warning">please note</span> that this code will not work well without gutters, which come next, but we're going step by step to be absolutely clear and not overwhelm you with information right off the bat.</p>
                <p><span class="ink-label info">Code</span></p>
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;div class=&quot;ink-grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;column-group&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;large-80&quot;&gt;A main 80% column&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;large-20&quot;&gt;A 20% sidebar&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;                </pre>
                <h4>Basic columns: available widths</h4>
                <p>Available column widths are: 10, 20, 25, 30, 33, 40, 50, 60, 66, 70, 75, 80, 90 and 100%</p>
                <p><span class="ink-label info">Example combinations</span></p>

                    <div class="large-33 medium-33 small-33"><p>33%</p></div>
                    <div class="large-33 medium-33 small-33"><p>33%</p></div>
                    <div class="large-25 medium-25 small-25"><p>25%</p></div>
                    <div class="large-25 medium-25 small-25"><p>25%</p></div>
                    <div class="large-25 medium-25 small-25"><p>25%</p></div>
                    <div class="large-25 medium-25 small-25"><p>25%</p></div>
                
                </div>
                <p>The previous grid shows only a few of the possible combinations you can make with the 14 available widths, we'll leave you to imagine the rest, and go on to our last, but not least, basic layout element.</p>
                <h3>The gutters</h3>
                <p>In order to create space between your columns, you will need to add gutters. As you might have guessed by the straight-forwardedness of Ink's class names so far, the class to use in this case is <code>gutters</code>. Just add the class to your <code>column-group</code> block and you're set.</p>
                <p>So now you have all the basic elements to build an Ink layout: a container, a column group, columns and gutters. So now we can put it all together, picking up where we left off in our example code.</p>
                <p><span class="ink-label info">Code</span></p>
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;div class=&quot;ink-grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;column-group gutters&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;large-80&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A main 80% column&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;large-20&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A 20% sidebar&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;                </pre>
                <p>And that's your basic Ink layout. If you want to follow up with, say, four 25% columns, you just add a <code>column-group</code> with <code>gutters</code>, then create each of the <code>large-25</code> elements and you're good to go.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="nav-usage">
                <h2>Practical Usage</h2>
                <h4>Simple layout </h4>
                <p>By now, you've realized that Ink's approach is not a grid approach in which blocks fall neatly onto a predetermined grid of a fixed number of underlying columns, this really makes it flexible and easy to understand and keep track of code, but it can also mess with your OCD, you you're the "neatly aligned" kind of person.</p>
                <p>However, you can easily bend Ink to your will, by staying within a certain divisor range in your layouts. If you opt for 20 as your base, use 60/40, 20/20/20/20/20 or 80/20 and build layouts that fall on a grid without the constriction of actually having one. If you prefer 25, then use 50 and 75, for example. It's easy and it lets you keep the flexibility of percentage-based layout.</p>
                <p><span class="ink-label info">20%-based layout example</span></p>

                <p><span class="ink-label warning">Please note</span> for small screens we went with 100% stacked blocks, since there wasn't enough space to keep the 20% grid anymore, but if you check the layout on a medium or large screens you can clearly see how an underlying grid is apparent, even when Ink doesn't have a formal grid system.</p>
                <h3>Column nesting</h3>
                <p>Now, obviously, not all layouts are as simple as a content area with a sidebar, a header a footer. Sometimes, layouts get really intricate and, although we advocate simplicity, Ink allows for all the nesting your project may need.</p>
                <p>As a simple example, let's stick with the main column and sidebar layout, but let's make a running sidebar alongside a more complex main area.</p>
                <p>We'll start with our main code, which defined a 80% main area and a 20% sidebar, and we'll say the main area has a large picture, followed by two columns with some highlights and then it breaks into four columns with product feature descriptions. All the while, the sidebar will continue.</p>
                <p>Simply start adding rows with columns inside the main column and you're done. Remember, percentages are relative units, so when you put a 50% column inside your 80% main area, you're getting half of the 80%, meaning 40% of total space. And that's all you need to keep in mind when nesting columns with Ink.</p>

                <h3>Clearing floats</h3>
                <p>Should you need to clear floating elements, Ink gives you the <code>ink-clear</code> <code>ink-clear-left</code> and <code>ink-clear-right</code> utility classes.</p>
                <p>If, for whatever reason, you want two columns to be stacked instead of side-by-side, just apply the appropriate clear class, like in the example below.</p>
                <p><span class="ink-label info">Code</span></p>
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">

                <p><span class="ink-label warning">Please note</span> that this can easily be achieved by wrapping each column in an <code>ink-row</code> element, which may add extra code, but in the long run is easier to read and maintain.</p>

                <h2>Adding Space</h2>
                <p>Ink is carefully crafted to maximize legibility and readability, not only in what comes to typography, but also spacing. So, using the basics that you've learned above, you should obtain industry-standard results for presenting your content and not really have to worry much about it, unless if you need deeper customization.</p>
                <p>However, sometimes, extra space is essential and so Ink ships with a few simple spacer classes. Add a <code>space</code> <code>vspace</code> or <code>hspace</code> class to any block-level element to obtain and all around space, a vertical space or a horizontal space, respectively.</p>
                <p><span class="ink-label info">Tip</span> If you're trying to vertically space layout elements, you should place your <code>vspace</code> in the <code>column-group</code> element.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="nav-screens">
                <h2>Multiple Screens</h2>
                <p>As the web becomes more and more device-agnostic, your layouts need to be more flexible and adaptable. That's why there isn't a "normal" and a "responsive" Ink, there's just Ink and it does everything out of the box.</p>
                <p>You may have already guessed, from previous examples, how easy it is to build for three screen sizes, but let's dig a little deeper and see how it all works.</p>
                <h4>Layout for large, medium &amp; small screens</h4>
                <p>So far, we've talked about the 14 different widths you can divide your layout in, using classes such as <code>large-50</code> and <code>large-25</code>, now let's talk about 'medium' and 'small' layouts.</p>
                <p>Using 'large-', 'medium-' and 'small-', together with the 14 widths, you can define how much space each of your containers takes up in each screen; so, imagine you need a column that takes up 25% of a large screen, 50% of a medium screen and 100% of a small one.</p>
                <p><span class="ink-label info">Code</span></p>
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;div class=&quot;large-25 medium-50 small-100&quot;&gt;                </pre>
                <p>This is all you need to do to get your layouts behaving differently in each of three screen sizes. Just make sure you build your large layout <strong>first</strong> so that you get all the <code>column-group</code> elements right, because these are crucial to keep stuff together.</p>
                <p>So, to keep things simple, Ink defines three <strong>breakpoints</strong>, with the following widths:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SMALL</strong> which catches everything below <strong>650 pixels</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>MEDIUM</strong> which works between <strong>651 and 960 pixels</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>LARGE</strong> which catches everything above <strong>961 pixels</strong></li>
                 </ul>
                <h4>Customizing breakpoints </h4>
                <p>You can find the media queries for the three breakpoints in the <code>ink.css</code> file.</p>
                <p><span class="ink-label warning">Caution is advised</span> Customization comes at a price: when we update Ink in the future you'll have to repeat any customization made on the file we provide. We usualy advise you to keep your changes in a separate file, but in this case, you can't do that.</p>
                <p><strong>Coming soon</strong>, we'll add breakpoint customization to your fantastic <a href="http://ink.sapo.pt/index.php/download">Ink Customizer</a>.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, if you do decide to customize the breakpoints provided, you can do this by <strong>editing the <code>ink.css</code> by hand</strong> and changing the values on those media-queries. (A regular search in the file for "@media" will get you there).</p>
                <p><span class="ink-label info">Example</span> Using only two layouts (large and small)</p>
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
/* INK: LARGE SCREENS - ENABLED */
@media screen and (min-width: 767px) {
(...)

/* INK: MEDIUM SCREENS - DISABLED */
@media screen and (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 0px) {
(...)

/* INK: SMALL SCREENS - ENABLED */
@media screen and (max-width: 766px) {
(...)                  </pre>
                <p><span class="ink-label info">Note</span> that you can just customize the values. In this example we show how robust and extensible this approach allows you to be. Just don't remove the entire media-query because you may change your mind later in the project.</p>
                <p>If you want to simplify your code, for a matter of speed, for example, you may opt to use only large class names, such as <code>ink-l80</code>. In this case, everything below the medium breakpoint will revert to 100% width stacked blocks.</p>
                <p>If you don't want this default behavior to happen, then disable all breakpoints safe for large. Here's the code to do it:</p>
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
/* INK: LARGE SCREENS - ENABLED */
@media screen and (min-width: 0px) {
(...)

/* INK: MEDIUM SCREENS - DISABLED */
@media screen and (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 0px) {
(...)

/* INK: SMALL SCREENS - DISABLED */
@media screen and (max-width: 0px) {
(...)                 </pre>
            </section>
            <section id="nav-showhide">
                <h2>Showing &amp; Hiding</h2>
                <p>Building a truly flexible and responsive layout isn't just about offering different layouts or sizes for your blocks, sometimes you need to make decisions that involve only showing certain things in certain screens or even, duplicating blocks to show one version on large screens and a different one on smaller screens. All that is not only possible, but really simple with Ink.</p>
                <p>Instead of saying what you want to hide, just say where you want things to show up, using three classes that match the three layout sizes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>.ink-for-s</code> only appears when Layout <strong>Small</strong> is active</li>
                    <li><code>.ink-for-m</code> only appears when Layout <strong>Medium</strong> is active</li>
                    <li><code>.ink-for-l</code> only appears when Layout <strong>Large</strong> is active</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So, again, if you build a block that has some information you only need to make available for people on smartphones, just add the <code>ink-for-s</code> class to the container and that block will only be made visible on small screens. Don't worry about document reflows, Ink uses a non-destructive method to hide stuff, so to speak.</p>
                <p><span class="ink-label info">Note</span> that content hidden via these classes won't be read out loud by screenreaders.</p>
                <p>Let's use some text for a really simple example. Say you have a sentence you want to make progressively longer in each screen width:</p>
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;p class=&quot;ink-for-s&quot;&gt;I love Mexican food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ink-for-m&quot;&gt;I love Mexican food, such as guacamole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ink-for-l&quot;&gt;I love Mexican food, such as guacamole and would eat it every day if I could.&lt;/p&gt;                </pre>
                <p>In the example above, smaller screens would only see the shorter sentence as the remaining two paragraphs would be hidden, on a medium screen the second, longer version would be visible and on a large screen, only the last, longest paragraph would be displayed.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="nav-customization">
                <h2>Further Customization</h2>
                <p>No matter how simple and ready-to-use a framework is, there is always a great need for customization, such is the nature of designing for the web (and for any other media, actually).</p>
                <p>In this section, we'll try to tackle some usual issues, to help you along the way. Soon, though, we intend to build an extensive library of examples which will document all manner of Ink usages we might come across as more people use it.</p>
                <p><span class="ink-label success">Essential</span> For a flexible customization of your pages, while still adhering to Ink and being able to update the framework to future versions or bug-fix releases, the best option is always to add <strong>semantic classes</strong> of your own, to your blocks.</p>
                <p>In essence, if you define your main content area as taking up 75% of the space with a left sidebar taking up the remaining 25%, don't just use the appropriate <code>large-25</code> and <code>large-75</code> classes, but also use your own <code>sidebar</code> and <code>content</code> classes.</p>
                <p>This will allow you to build your own customizations in a separate CSS file, while keeping Ink CSS 'clean'.</p>
                <p>Simply create a CSS file in the <code>css</code> directory, name it whatever best fits your project, let's say <code>custom.css</code> and then make the appropriate link in your document <code>head</code>, as long as it is after the <code>ink.css</code> link.</p>
                <p>So, if you're using the templates included with Ink, look for the following line:</p>
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;./css/ink.css&quot;&gt;                </pre>
                <p>And add your own link:</p>
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;./css/ink.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;./css/custom.css&quot;&gt;                </pre>
                <p><span class="ink-label caution">Remember!</span> don't go redefining what a <code>large-50</code> or <code>column-group</code> do, just add one more class to the block you need to alter and then, using the appropriate specificity, define it in your custom CSS.</p>
